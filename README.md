# Next RGBus

This is a simple application intended to pull the next arrival time of a bus or train and display the number of minutes remaining. Perfect for the busy professional who needs to know exactly when they need to get out the door!!

This application is based on the great work over at Adafruit and is compatible with the HUB75-based RGB matrices that they sell.
